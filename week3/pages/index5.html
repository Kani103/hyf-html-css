       <h2>Jupiter Ascending Screen Graphics</h2>
         <p>Territory Studio recently worked with The Wachowski’s to create the screen
            graphics for their new science fiction action adventure Jupiter Ascending.
            Using conventions commonly seen in weather maps, they created 
            a series of graphics ‘to articulate various cloaked spaceships and wormhole events’,
            in addition to other unseen happenings.
            These stunning graphics were also complemented by a bespoke typeface created by Territory,
            which coheres with the futuristic aesthetic of these organic visual interpretations.
            More images and video after the jump.</p>
