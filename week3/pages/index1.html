        <h2>The Counter Press Business Cards</h2>
          <p>The Counter Press are a letterpress studio and workshop based in an old 
              chocolate factory in Londonâ€™s East End,
               whose folio boasts a gorgeous array of contemporary typographic work. 
               Since launching three years ago the studio has finally found the time 
               to design and produce their very own business cards.
              The large typography on the back, which is printed in a variety of wood letter faces,
               beautifully contrasts with the simple front that is elegantly handset in 8pt Plantin.
                I also love the fluro orange edge painting!</p>
